a **sample UPSC essay** on a relevant and thought-provoking topic, written in a formal and analytical tone, suitable for the UPSC Mains Essay Paper (Paper I):\n\n---\n\n### **Topic: \"Technology is a Useful Servant but a Dangerous Master\"**\n\n---\n\n#### **Introduction**\n\nThe 21st century stands as a testimony to mankind's unprecedented technological advancements. From artificial intelligence to quantum computing, and from biotechnology to space exploration, technology has reshaped human civilization. Yet, as French philosopher Christian Lous Lange rightly said, \"Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.\" This statement encapsulates a profound truth—technology, when controlled, enhances life; when uncontrolled, it threatens the very fabric of society.\n\n---\n\n#### **The Dual Nature of Technology**\n\nTechnology has always been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it facilitates progress, improves quality of life, and solves complex problems. On the other, it poses risks—surveillance, job displacement, ethical dilemmas, and even existential threats. The internet is a tool for both education and misinformation. Nuclear energy powers cities but can also destroy them.\n\n---\n\n#### **Technology as a Useful Servant**\n\n1. **Economic Growth**: Automation and digitalization have increased productivity, lowered costs, and created new markets.\n\n2. **Healthcare Advancements**: Robotic surgeries, mRNA vaccines, and AI diagnostics have revolutionized medical science, saving countless lives.\n\n3. **Governance and Transparency**: E-governance, Aadhaar, and digital payments have increased accessibility and reduced corruption.\n\n4. **Disaster Management**: Satellite imagery and early warning systems have mitigated the impact of natural disasters.\n\n---\n\n#### **When the Servant Becomes the Master**\n\n1. **Surveillance Capitalism**: Corporations and governments harvest personal data to influence behavior, raising concerns about privacy and autonomy.\n\n2. **AI and Bias**: Algorithms trained on biased data can perpetuate discrimination in hiring, lending, and policing.\n\n3. **Addiction and Mental Health**: The overuse of smartphones and social media is linked to increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness.\n\n4. **Weaponization of Technology**: Cyberwarfare, drone strikes, and autonomous weapons challenge ethical and legal norms of conflict.\n\n---\n\n#### **India's Challenge and Opportunity**\n\nIndia stands at a critical juncture. As a developing nation, technology can bridge infrastructure gaps, enhance education, and empower citizens. Initiatives like Digital India, National AI Mission, and the UPI payment system showcase how tech can be a powerful enabler.\n\nHowever, with growing digitization, India must also ensure data protection (e.g., the Digital Personal Data Protection Act), curb misinformation, and build ethical frameworks for emerging technologies.\n\n---\n\n#### **The Way Forward**\n\n* **Human-Centric AI**: Algorithms must align with democratic values and human rights.\n* **Regulation and Oversight**: Independent regulatory bodies should oversee tech development and deployment.\n* **Education and Awareness**: Citizens must be digitally literate to use technology responsibly.\n* **International Cooperation**: Global challenges like cybercrime and AI ethics require multilateral engagement.\n\n---\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nTechnology, like fire, is a good servant but a bad master. It should serve humanity, not rule it. The key lies in maintaining the delicate balance between innovation and regulation, progress and precaution. As India aspires to become a digital superpower, it must wield technology with wisdom, ensuring it remains a tool of empowerment rather than a force of domination.\n\n---\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-08T07:20:16.084725Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-08T07:20:16.085156Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-08T07:20:16.091226Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-08T07:20:16.085131Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-08T07:20:16.090159Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt= f'Evaluate the essay from 0 to 10 and provide a feedback on the essay: {essay}'","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-08T07:22:36.818717Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-08T07:22:36.819026Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-08T07:22:36.823340Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-08T07:22:36.819003Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-08T07:22:36.822589Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result = structured_model.invoke(prompt)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-08T07:23:09.958694Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-08T07:23:09.959019Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-08T07:23:15.525727Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-08T07:23:09.958994Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-08T07:23:15.524800Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(result)\nprint(result.feedback)\nprint(result.score)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-08T07:23:52.931000Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-08T07:23:52.931302Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-08T07:23:52.936616Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-08T07:23:52.931282Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-08T07:23:52.935679Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"feedback='The essay is well-structured, presenting a balanced view of technology\\'s potential benefits and dangers.
